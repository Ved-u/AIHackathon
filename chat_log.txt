USER (2025-09-18 20:38:39): give 3 rules of monopoly
BOT (2025-09-18 20:38:39):  Based on the provided context, here are three rules of Monopoly:

1. A player's aim is to become the monopolist by owning all properties of a color group and building hotels on them.
2. When a player lands on a property that another player owns, the owner can demand rent from the player according to the prices printed on the title deed or hotel.
3. If a player cannot pay the demanded rent, they must give up one randomly chosen property of their choice to the property owner. If a player still cannot pay, they are bankrupt and eliminated from the game.
